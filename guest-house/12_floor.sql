-- Check out per floor. The first digit of the room number indicates the floor â€“ e.g. room 201 is on the 2nd floor. For each day of the week beginning 2016-11-14 show how many rooms are being vacated that day by floor number. Show all days in the correct order.

-- Can check how many floors first with a query: 3.
-- Assume no rooms on ground floor, or check
-- Generate 1 column for each floor, date as index
