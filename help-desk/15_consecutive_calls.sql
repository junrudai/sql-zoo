/*
Consecutive calls occur when an operator deals with two callers within 10 minutes. Find the longest sequence of consecutive calls â€“ give the name of the operator and the first and last call date in the sequence.

Questions:
 - Call_date only, no duration?

1. get the lag for each call date
2. Calculate the time difference and check
3. Get streak numbers
4. Groupby each streak to get max size
5. Join back with original table to get other data
